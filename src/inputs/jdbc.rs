/// This plugin was created as a way to ingest data in any database with a JDBC interface into Logstash. You can periodically schedule ingestion using a cron syntax (see schedule setting) or run the query one time to load data into Logstash. Each row in the resultset becomes a single event. Columns in the resultset are converted into fields in the event.
